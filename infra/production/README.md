# Production deployment — one host, docker compose

This directory is the whole deployment: a reverse proxy, Postgres, Redis,
MinIO, the API, a second process serving the sample origin, and a cron
loop. There is no Kubernetes here and no cloud service; the target is one
Linux box you control.

Read [What you are NOT getting](#what-you-are-not-getting) before you rely
on this for casework. It is short and it is the honest part.

---

## Before you start

You need:

* A Linux host with Docker Engine and the Compose v2 plugin, and root on it.
* **Two** DNS names pointing at that host — one for the console, one for
  sample downloads. They must be genuinely separate names. Invariant 10
  puts hostile bytes on an origin that holds no analyst session, and the
  runtime cannot tell a real split from a CNAME onto the same host
  (`docs/16` C9), so nothing will catch it for you if they are not.
* Ports 80 and 443 reachable from wherever your analysts are. Nothing else
  is published: Postgres, Redis, MinIO and both application processes are
  reachable only from the compose network.
* A checkout of this repository on the host. Every command below is run
  from the repository root.

Counsel has work to do before an analyst signs in — see
[What stays red, and what a red check refuses](#what-stays-red-and-what-a-red-check-refuses).
Doing it after the stack is up is fine; doing it after the first ingest is
not, and the collection route refuses to poll until it is done.

---

## 1. Write the secrets file

```sh
cp infra/production/secrets.env.example infra/production/secrets.env
```

`secrets.env.example` is the reference for every variable: what it is, and
what breaks when it is wrong. Work through it top to bottom. Nothing in the
stack checks that you replaced the placeholders, and several of them fail
quietly rather than loudly.

Generate passwords from a URL-safe alphabet, because four of them are
embedded in URLs and an unencoded `@`, `:`, `/` or `#` silently truncates a
DSN into a different, valid-looking one:

```sh
python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```

**The TOTP key-encrypting key** is the one value with a shape requirement.
It must be base64 that decodes to **exactly 32 bytes** — this is the method
`release/install.sh` uses, and it checks the length for a reason. In this
deployment the boot check catches a bad one for you: `NOCTORNAL_ENV` is
`production`, so the API runs the envelope's own reader before it serves
anything and refuses to start, by name. Everywhere else the first thing to
notice is a second factor that cannot be sealed or opened — a different
program, long after anyone would connect the two.

```sh
python3 -c "import base64, os; print(base64.b64encode(os.urandom(32)).decode())"
```

Losing that key means every user must re-enrol their authenticator. Back it
up somewhere that is not this host.

Then lock the file down. It holds every password in the deployment:

```sh
sudo chown root:root infra/production/secrets.env
sudo chmod 600      infra/production/secrets.env
```

> `docker compose config` prints this file's contents, resolved into each
> service's environment. Do not paste that output into a ticket.

---

## 2. Check the two passwords that are written twice

`POSTGRES_PASSWORD` also appears inside `NOCTORNAL_MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL`,
and `NOCTORNAL_APP_DB_PASSWORD` also appears inside `DATABASE_URL`. Nothing
compares them. A mismatch surfaces on first boot as the migration job
failing to authenticate, which reads like a bug in the migration.

There are two Postgres roles on purpose. `noctornal` owns the schema and is
the only thing that ever runs Alembic. `noctornal_app` is least privilege,
is not the owner, and cannot `ALTER TABLE ... DISABLE TRIGGER` — which is
precisely what a compromised API process would want in order to write
around the audit and custody chains. The app role is created by
`db/init/10-app-role.sh` **at initdb**, and initdb scripts run once against
an empty data directory: changing `NOCTORNAL_APP_DB_PASSWORD` later does
nothing to an existing cluster, and you have to `ALTER ROLE` by hand.

---

## 3. Give MinIO a certificate

The API refuses to start unless `MINIO_SECURE` and `SAMPLE_SECURE` are both
`true` (`apps/api/src/noctornal_api/config.py`). The argument is not about
the password — under SigV4 the secret key never crosses the wire — it is
that every exhibit's bytes do, and each request carries a signature
anything on the path can lift and replay against the evidence bucket until
it expires.

MinIO looks for `public.crt` and `private.key` in its certificate
directory, so those are exactly the names:

```sh
mkdir -p infra/production/tls
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -days 3650 -nodes \
  -keyout infra/production/tls/private.key \
  -out    infra/production/tls/public.crt \
  -subj   "/CN=minio" \
  -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:minio"
sudo chown root:root infra/production/tls/private.key
sudo chmod 600       infra/production/tls/private.key
```

`DNS:minio` is load-bearing. `minio` is the compose service name, it is
what `MINIO_ENDPOINT` and `SAMPLE_ENDPOINT` address, and it is the name
each client checks the handshake against. A certificate for anything else
produces a hostname-mismatch error on the first exhibit.

The certificate is self-signed and no public CA vouches for it, so the
application containers are told to trust it: each one concatenates the
system CA bundle with `public.crt` at start and points `SSL_CERT_FILE` at
the result.

It is a concatenation rather than the certificate alone because the clients
in this build do not read that variable the same way. The MinIO client
hands it to urllib3 as `ca_certs`, which makes that file the *entire* set of
roots the evidence, raw and sample clients will trust. Everything else —
RSS collection, the webhook channel, SMTP, the readiness probe — goes
through OpenSSL's default verify paths, which are `SSL_CERT_FILE` **and**
`SSL_CERT_DIR`; the directory still points at `/etc/ssl/certs` and the image
ships the hashed symlinks, so those clients keep the public roots either
way. Pointing the variable straight at `public.crt` would therefore not
break them, whatever the certificate count suggests. The concatenation is
kept because it costs one `cat` and removes the dependency on a base image
that ships those symlinks.

`infra/production/tls/` is gitignored.

---

## 4. Start it

```sh
docker compose -p noctornal-prod -f infra/production/compose.yml up -d --build
```

`--build` matters. Compose reuses an existing local image tag, so after any
code change an `up -d` without it redeploys the old image and you see no
change.

The order is enforced by the file, not by you: Postgres reaches a real TCP
healthcheck, the migration job runs `alembic upgrade head` as the owner and
must succeed, MinIO's buckets are created, and only then do the API, the
sample origin and the cron loop start. A migration that will not apply
means an API that never starts, which is the correct outcome — code ahead
of its schema fails on the first query touching a new column and reports
that as a bug in whatever endpoint happened to run first.

Watch it come up:

```sh
docker compose -p noctornal-prod -f infra/production/compose.yml ps
docker compose -p noctornal-prod -f infra/production/compose.yml logs -f migrate api
```

`migrate` and `minio-init` are one-shot and are expected to sit in `exited
(0)`. Everything else should be `running`, and `api` and `sample-origin`
should reach `healthy`.

### If the API refuses to start

It will print every reason at once, each naming a variable and what it
costs. That list is the whole fix — there is no second problem waiting
behind the first. It never quotes a value, so the output is safe to read
over someone's shoulder.

### If `up` fails creating the network

`Pool overlaps with other one on this address space` means another Docker
network on this host already holds `172.31.243.0/24`. Pick a free /24 and
change it in **two** places in `compose.yml`: the `networks:` block at the
bottom and the `x-caddy-ip` alias at the top. They must agree — the second
is the address uvicorn is told to trust for `X-Forwarded-For`.

---

## 5. Create the first account

While `iam.app_user` is empty — and only then — one unauthenticated route
creates the first administrator. It hands out `SYS_ADMIN`,
`SECURITY_OFFICER`, `CASE_OWNER` and `ANALYST`, which is right for a
single-operator install and clears the two account-shaped readiness items
in one call — `security_officer_present`, which is blocking, and
`sys_admin_present`, which is not. It answers 409 forever afterwards, and
it counts every row, active or not.

```sh
curl -sS -X POST https://YOUR-CONSOLE-HOSTNAME/api/v1/setup/first-admin \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"you@example.org","display_name":"Your Name"}'
```

Add `-k` while `NOCTORNAL_TLS_MODE=internal`: those certificates come from
Caddy's own CA and nothing public trusts them.

**The credentials come back once and are not retrievable.** Save them, then
sign in at `https://YOUR-CONSOLE-HOSTNAME/ui` and enrol your authenticator.

If the route is not reachable for some reason, the same job can be done
from a container:

```sh
docker compose -p noctornal-prod -f infra/production/compose.yml \
  run --rm --no-deps api python scripts/bootstrap.py create-user \
  --email you@example.org --name "Your Name" \
  --roles SYS_ADMIN,SECURITY_OFFICER,CASE_OWNER,ANALYST
```

Note the explicit `--roles`: the script's own default is
`CASE_OWNER,SYS_ADMIN` and leaves you with no `SECURITY_OFFICER`, which
means break-glass refuses every request because nobody can review one.

---

## 6. The readiness register

```
GET /api/v1/admin/readiness
```

Thirteen checks, each with the evidence behind it and, when it fails, the
action that fixes it. It needs `user.manage`, which is a step-up
permission, so re-enter your second factor first.

`ready: true` means the code-side preconditions hold. It does **not** mean
the deployment is lawful, and `readiness.py` is explicit that it never did:
several entries in `docs/16` are decisions only a human can take, and the
software records declarations it cannot verify.

The sample origin runs its own copy of the register at the same path on its
own hostname, and that is the only way to confirm the split from the
outside: the process there should report `sample_origin_configured` as
"this process is the sample origin", while the console's reports "this
process is configured as the application origin and refuses every
download". Both are correct. That pair of answers is the origin split
working.

> The sample-origin process serves only the sample download, its preflight,
> `/healthz` and that readiness endpoint. Everything else 404s there, on
> purpose: the console, the login form and every case route must not exist
> at the hostname that serves hostile bytes.

### What stays red, and what a red check refuses

Four of the thirteen are **blocking** (`readiness.BLOCKING_CHECKS`):
`prohibited_content_policy`, `sample_origin_configured`,
`retention_rules_confirmed` and `security_officer_present`. "Blocking" is
not a synonym for important — everything in the register is important. It
means a caller refuses on it: `POST /api/v1/collection/sources/{id}/run`
answers 409 and names the failing checks while any of the four is open, so
a covert poll against a real target cannot run before somebody has settled
them.

`sample_origin_configured` is on that list and should be green by the time
you get here: step 1 sets `NOCTORNAL_SAMPLE_ORIGIN`, and this compose file
runs the second process that satisfies it. The other three are the ones a
correctly configured stack still comes up red on, because two of them are
decisions nobody but a human can take and the third needs an account that
does not exist yet.

`sys_admin_present` is also red on a fresh stack and is deliberately **not**
blocking — `readiness.py` says why at length: it is an operability failure
rather than a decision taken too late, and refusing on it would land on
somebody who cannot act on the refusal, because the register that explains
it needs `user.manage` and `SYS_ADMIN` is the only role that holds it.

**1. `prohibited_content_policy`** — `docs/16` L1. Sample ingest is refused
until `NOCTORNAL_PROHIBITED_CONTENT_POLICY` and
`NOCTORNAL_DESIGNATED_PERSON` are set, and setting them is a declaration,
not a control: a false one produces a working system and an unlawful
deployment. Counsel has to write the policy first, and it has to settle who
is notified when screening trips, what the `REJECTED` path does with the
bytes (this build **destroys** them, which is the wrong answer in a
jurisdiction that requires preservation), the reporting obligations in both
operating jurisdictions, and whether you are authorised to hold known-
material hash sets at all. Then point the variable at something an auditor
can follow and restart the API.

**2. `retention_rules_confirmed`** — `docs/16` D3. Six retention rules ship
as placeholders. The periods are jurisdictional and this build cannot
choose them, so each one waits for a named human to attach a rationale:

```
GET  /api/v1/retention/rules            (lists which are still placeholders)
POST /api/v1/retention/rules/{category} {"retain_days": N, "rationale": "..."}
```

`retention.manage` is step-up gated. The point of the confirmation is not
the number — it is that somebody's id is attached to it, and that the
rationale answers "why does this category expire when it does" to somebody
who was not in the room.

**3. `security_officer_present`** (blocking) and **`sys_admin_present`**
(not) — both are cleared by step 5, which is why that step grants both
roles. `audit.read` and break-glass review are held by `SECURITY_OFFICER`
alone, and `user.manage` by `SYS_ADMIN` alone: with neither, the only
repair path is a database shell.

`smtp_configured` will also be red until `SMTP_HOST` names a relay that
speaks TLS. That one is configuration rather than a decision, and
`SMTP_ALLOW_PLAINTEXT` must stay unset — it exists for a development
Mailpit, and a production deployment carrying it sends case summaries in
the clear on the day STARTTLS fails.

---

## Day-to-day

**Logs.** Everything logs to stdout.

```sh
docker compose -p noctornal-prod -f infra/production/compose.yml logs -f api
docker compose -p noctornal-prod -f infra/production/compose.yml logs -f cron
```

The cron container prints a timestamped start and exit code for each pass.
`notify_drain` exits 1 when a delivery failed in that pass — information,
not a reason to stop draining — so a persistent non-zero every five minutes
is the thing to look at. The failed deliveries are in the ledger with their
reasons at `GET /api/v1/notifications/deliveries?refused_only=true`.

**Updating.** Pull the code, then rebuild and restart. The migration job
runs again on every `up`, so a release carrying migrations applies them
before the API starts:

```sh
git pull
docker compose -p noctornal-prod -f infra/production/compose.yml up -d --build
```

**Backups — nothing here does this for you.** Two things must be copied off
this host, together, or a restore gives you a case file whose exhibits are
missing:

```sh
# The database.
docker compose -p noctornal-prod -f infra/production/compose.yml exec -T postgres \
  sh -c 'PGPASSWORD="$POSTGRES_PASSWORD" pg_dump -h 127.0.0.1 -U noctornal noctornal' \
  > noctornal-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ).sql

# The object store. Evidence AND raw captures: an exhibit restored
# without the capture it was derived from has lost half of what makes it
# an exhibit.
#   mc mirror --overwrite local/noctornal-evidence /your/backup/evidence
#   mc mirror --overwrite local/noctornal-raw      /your/backup/raw
#
# The samples bucket is deliberately NOT in this list. It holds live
# malware, and docs/11's rejection path DESTROYS sample bytes — a mirror
# of it puts a destroyed sample somewhere that path cannot reach, which
# is the one outcome the whole prohibited-content decision exists to
# prevent. Copy it only if counsel has said to, and to somewhere the
# rejection procedure covers.
```

Also copy `secrets.env` itself. Without `NOCTORNAL_TOTP_KEK` a restored
database is a database nobody can complete a login against.

**Stopping.**

```sh
docker compose -p noctornal-prod -f infra/production/compose.yml down
```

Never add `-v` to that unless you mean it. It destroys `prod-pgdata` (the
case file), `prod-miniodata` (the evidence) and `caddy-data` (the ACME
account and every issued certificate — and issuance is rate-limited per
hostname per week). The evidence bucket's objects are written under a
COMPLIANCE object lock, which nobody can lift, including the root
credential: destroying the volume is the only way to remove them, which is
the property evidence is supposed to have.

## What you are NOT getting

* **No high availability.** One host. When it is down, the product is down,
  and there is no failover to anything.
* **No backups.** The volumes are on one disk on this machine. The commands
  above are a manual procedure nothing runs for you, and nothing verifies a
  restore.
* **No audit of this deployment.** The application's own audit chain covers
  what analysts do inside it. Nothing here records who ran `docker compose`,
  edited `secrets.env` or read a volume.
* **No monitoring.** No metrics, no alerting, no log aggregation. The
  readiness register answers when you ask it and tells nobody otherwise —
  nothing anywhere reads its verdict on a schedule.
* **No secrets management.** `secrets.env` is a file on disk in plain text.
  There is no Vault, no KMS, and the TOTP key-encrypting key sits in it.
  Every container built from the application image receives the whole file,
  and so does Caddy, which needs three of its variables.
* **`docs/16` L1–L5 are unresolved.** Prohibited content in the sample
  store, stealer logs and third-party personal data at scale, persona
  operation and computer-misuse exposure, message content capture, and
  active capture of attacker infrastructure. Every one of them is a
  question for counsel, this file settles none of them, and a green
  readiness register does not either.
